# The available data sources and their usages

## Ghost Permit Data
Data that shows planning applications that have been approved, but not built.
Can be used to identify things a council are willing to approve, and have not become saturated yet.

## Housing Test Data
Data that shows, for each borough, how many houses they should make, and how many they have.
Boroughs severely under target are more likely to approve housing applications.
